Wrapper around pandas & scikit-learn for doing Data Analysis in python

Requirements
------------

1. Python
2. **pandas**
3. scikit-learn
4. matplotlib
5. tornado

Note: pandas is the only package that is required before installing copper, but is
recommended to have all other packages installed too.

Note 2: The package is developed for Python 3 and Python 2 with a single code base. But the main target is Python 3 so is recommended since most packages already support Python 3.

Install
-------

`pip install copper`

Features
--------

1. Project structure for Data Analysis projects ala [Project Template](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2010/08/26/projecttemplate/) on R.
2. Dataset: Wrapper around pandas.DataFrame to introduce metadata
3. Data transformation templates
4. Custom matplotlib charts for exploration: histograms, scatterplots
5. Exploration via D3.js (very experimental)
6. More data imputation options via R (rpy2)
7. Rapid Machine Learning prototyping:
