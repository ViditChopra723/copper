Copper objective is to make machine learning prototyping on python as fast and intuitive as possible.
To do so connects via the Dataset and Model Comparison classes the pandas and
scikit-learn projects.

Github page: Copper_

Examples
--------

1. Iris classification Iris_

Requirements
------------

1. pandas
2. scikit-learn

Note: The package is currently developed for Python 2.7 because scikit-learn does not support
python 3 yet. When scikit-learn supports python 3 this project will drop support for python 2 and
support only python 3.

I recommend using the Anaconda_ python distribution

Install
-------

``pip install copper``
