Copper
======

![Travis CI](https://api.travis-ci.org/danielfrg/copper.png)

Copper objective is to make machine learning prototyping on python as fast and intuitive as possible.
To do so connects via the Dataset and Model Comparison classes the pandas and
scikit-learn projects.

Examples
--------
1. [Iris classification](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/danielfrg/copper/master/docs/examples/iris/iris.ipynb)

Documentation and more info can be found on [copper.readthedocs.com](http://copper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Requirements
------------
1. pandas
2. scikit-learn

Note: The package is currently developed for Python 2.7 because scikit-learn does not support
python 3 yet. When scikit-learn supports python 3 this project will drop support for python 2
becuase all requirements will support python 3.

I recommend using the [Anaconda python distribution](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html)

Install
-------

`pip install copper`
